STR_INTRO_1         :Introductory Chapter{}{}Hello, and welcome to this ingame OpenTTD tutorial!
STR_INTRO_2         :Chapters:{}{}0. Introduction (this chapter){}1. Navigation{}2. Aircraft{}3. Ships (Incomplete){}4. Trucks (Incomplete){}5. Buses (Incomplete){}6. Trains (Incomplete){}{}The tutorial have been designed for taking the chapters in this order, but after each chapter you will be given an option to jump to whatever chapter you want.


STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_1_INTRO      :Aircraft - Building an Airport{}{}In this first chapter, you'll be shown how to transport passengers between two towns using aircraft. You'll start by building an airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_2_PLACEMENT  :You are going to build your first airport near this town. Click on the highlighted buttons, starting on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_3_ACCEPTANCE :To get the greatest number of passengers at your airport, you want to have as much of the town as possible within its coverage area. The small airport has a coverage area radius of four tiles, which can be shown using the GUI. Click on the highlighted button.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_4_ACCEPTANCE :At the bottom of the airport selection window, you can see two lines of text. One starts with "Accepts", while the other starts with "Supplies". After this, those cargo types which are currently available in the coverage area will be shown, both for collection ("Supplies") and delivery ("Accepts"). It's important to place your airport where it will both "Accept" and "Supply" passengers.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_5_PLACE_AP   :Move your cursor so that the white squares are on a flat area with no buildings or roads. Any trees will be removed automatically. Make sure that the blue squares, which show the coverage area of the airport, cover as much of the town as possible. Click on the ground to build the airport.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_1_WHERE      :Building a Second Airport{}{}In order to transport passengers they need somewhere to go. For this to be possible, you will need to build a second airport. This airport will be built reasonably far away from the first, as passengers generally pay your company more the further they travel. Your second airport should be built near a town with a similar population size to the first one, as this means that there will be an equal amount of passengers going in each direction. This time, you should build your second airport near {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_2_BUILD      :To build your second airport in {TOWN}, follow the same steps as when you built the first airport in {TOWN}, as shown by the highlighted buttons. 

STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_1_HANGAR     :Buying an Aircraft{}{}Now you are ready to buy your first aircraft. Click on the hangar building in the airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_2_BUY        :In OpenTTD, you buy the aircraft first, then assign orders to it. Click on the highlighted button to choose an aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_3_SELECT_AIRCRAFT :Select an aircraft by clicking on it, then click on the highlighted button to buy it. You may want to choose the Coleman Count, as this has the highest capacity.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_4_ORDERS     :Next, you will need to assign orders to the aircraft so that it knows where to go. Click on the highlighted button to open the orders window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_5_ORDERS     :Click anywhere on the airport in {TOWN}, excluding the hangar. This gives an order to the aircraft to go to this airport, and load any passengers and mail which are waiting.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_6_STATION_LIST :To get back to your first airport, you can use the station list window which shows a list of all of your stations. Click on the highlighted button on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_7_STATION_LIST :Click on {STATION} in the list.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_8_ORDERS     :Now, in the main viewport, click anywhere on the airport, excluding the hangar. 
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_9_START_AIRCRAFT :Now your aircraft has its orders. Close the orders window using the cross.{}{}The final step is to start your aircraft. Click once on the highlighted horizontal button in the aircraft's window to start it.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_1_SUM_UP     :Summary{}{}You have now completed your first transport route in OpenTTD. Before moving onto the next chapter, this tutorial will show you how to look at some more detailed information about your route.{}{}To see the number of passengers and the amount of mail waiting at an airport, click anywhere on the airport, excluding the hangar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_2_STATION_WINDOW :In this window, you can see at the top the cargo waiting to be collected from the airport. Knowing how many people are waiting at your airports is an important factor in deciding when you should buy another aircraft.{}{}Below the line, you can see the different cargo types that the airport accepts. These are the cargo types which can be delivered to this airport from another one. If you click on the ratings button, this will change to show you how good a rating your transport company has at this airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_3_AIRCRAFT_PROFIT :Another important piece of information to know is whether or not your aircraft is making a profit, and how many people are using the aircraft. Click on the highlighted button on the aircraft window to see the aircraft's details.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_4_AIRCRAFT_PROFIT :In this window you can see several pieces of information about your aircraft: yearly profit, how much cargo is currently loaded, capacity, etc.{}{}If you would like to rename your aircraft or change its service interval, you can do this using controls in this window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_5_DONE       :You have now completed the first chapter of this tutorial.{}{}Take a look at the aircraft in operation, then perhaps add another aircraft. When you feel ready to continue with this tutorial, close this window and all other windows by pressing the DELETE button on your keyboard.

# Other strings that are not in the regular timeline of messages
STR_AIRPLANES_CLICK_GO_TO      :Click on the highlighted Go To button.
STR_AIRPLANES_NOTICE_WAITING_FOR_AP_BUILD :The tutorial is waiting for you to build an airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_NOTICE_HANGAR_ORDER         :You have clicked on the hangar, not on the airport.{}{}1. Select the order concerning the hangar in the order window by clicking on it.{}2.Click on the delete button in the order window.{}3. Click on the Go To button.{}4. Try to add an order to {STATION} again by clicking somewhere on the airport other than the hangar.
STR_AIRPLANES_HANGAR_SIGN :Hangar


STR_SHIPS_2_1_1    :Ship dock construction{}{}In this part we are going to move oil from an oil rig to an oil refinery using a ship. First you will need to build a dock next to the oil refinery. When you click on continue, the main viewport will move there.
STR_SHIPS_2_1_2    :First you need to open the waterway construction window.
STR_SHIPS_2_1_3    :Good, now you need to select the ship dock and place it near the oil refinery in such a way the catchment area overlaps the oil refinery and half of the ship dock is on water.
STR_SHIPS_2_1_4    :Well done. The oil refinery can receive oil from ships now.

STR_SHIPS_2_2_1    :Ship depot construction{}{}Buying ships works the same as buying aircraft. However, while aircraft are bought in an hangar on the airport you need a separate depot for ships. So we are going to build one now.
STR_SHIPS_2_2_2    :Now, place it on the water near the ship dock, but don't block the ship dock.

STR_SHIPS_2_3_1    :Buying a ship and giving it orders{}{}Select the depot and buy a ship capable of transporting oil.
STR_SHIPS_2_3_2    :Ok, so now we are going to give it orders to pick up oil at the oil rig and transport it to the oil refinery.
STR_SHIPS_2_3_3    :Oh no! The oil rig hasn't got a ship dock next to it. No problem, it's got its own built in station. However, the oil refinery hasn't got its own built-in station. Give the ship orders for the oil rig and the ship dock next to the oil refinery.

STR_SHIPS_2_4_1    :The first order flag{}{}Now, let the ship leave the the depot. It'll go its merry way.
STR_SHIPS_2_4_2    :Good, lets see how much oil the ship is transporting. Take a look at the ships details window to find that out.
STR_SHIPS_2_4_3    :Well, it is transporting oil, but not much. Lets make our ship wait for a full load. In order to do that we need to edit the ship's orders a bit. So, lets open the ship's order window.
STR_SHIPS_2_4_4    :Now, click on the order for the oil rig.
STR_SHIPS_2_4_5    :Good, now look at the two rows of buttons at the bottom of the window. The top row is for order flags, the bottom row is for deleting or adding orders.
STR_SHIPS_2_4_6    :Click on "full load any cargo"
STR_SHIPS_2_4_7    :Notice the change in the order. When the ship next attends the oil rig it will wait for a full load of oil before departing. It will take some time for the ship to load, so we will just continue.

STR_SHIPS_2_5_1    :Canals{}{}Well our first ship will handle itself just fine now, however there is a second oil rig somewhere else. However there is a slight problem; we cannot reach it as there as no sea route between our oil refinery and the oil rig.{}{}There are two ways to create a route to that oil rig. The first is to simply lower the land to create a path the second is to create a canal. We are going to create a canal, terraforming will come later.
STR_SHIPS_2_5_2    :Start by selecting the canal.
STR_SHIPS_2_5_3    :Now, start laying down canal tiles between the two highlighted tiles.
STR_SHIPS_2_5_4    :Now, select the build lock tool.
STR_SHIPS_2_5_5    :Locks can only be placed on sloped tiles. You will notice that when you hover over a sloped tile, with this tool selected, that it will not only highlight the tile you are hovering above, but also two of it's neighboring tiles (one land tile and one sea tile or canal tile). When that happens you can place a lock. Now place a lock at either end of our canal.
STR_SHIPS_2_5_6    :Good, now you can build a ship and make it transport oil from the new oil rig to our oil refinery. Perhaps it's a good idea to make that ship wait for a full load too.

STR_SHIPS_2_5_7    :Rounding up{}{}Finally! We're done with ships. There are some more oil rigs around the map, why don't you try and connect them to the oil refinery. Alternatively you could just move on to the next chapter by clicking next.

STR_SHIPS_NOTICE_WAITING_FOR_DOCK_BUILD :The tutorial is waiting for you to build a dock near {INDUSTRY}.
