STR_INTRO_2         :Chapters:{}{}1. Aircraft{}2. Ships (Incomplete){}3. Road Vehicles (Incomplete){}4. Trains (Incomplete)


STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_1_INTRO      :Aircraft - Building an Airport{}{}In this first chapter, you'll be shown how to transport passengers between two towns using aircraft. You'll start by building an airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_2_PLACEMENT  :You are going to build your first airport near this town. Click on the highlighted buttons, starting on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_3_ACCEPTANCE :To get the greatest number of passengers at your airport, you want to have as much of the town as possible within its coverage area. The small airport has a coverage area radius of four tiles, which can be shown using the GUI. Click on the highlighted button.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_4_ACCEPTANCE :At the bottom of the airport selection window, you can see two lines of text. One starts with "Accepts", while the other starts with "Supplies". After this, those cargo types which are currently available in the coverage area will be shown, both for collection ("Supplies") and delivery ("Accepts"). It's important to place your airport where it will both "Accept" and "Supply" passengers.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_5_PLACE_AP   :Move your cursor so that the white squares are on a flat area with no buildings or roads. Any trees will be removed automatically. Make sure that the blue squares, which show the coverage area of the airport, cover as much of the town as possible. Click on the ground to build the airport.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_1_WHERE      :Building a Second Airport{}{}In order to transport passengers they need somewhere to go. For this to be possible, you will need to build a second airport. This airport will be built reasonably far away from the first, as passengers generally pay your company more the further they travel. Your second airport should be built near a town with a similar population size to the first one, as this means that there will be an equal amount of passengers going in each direction. This time, you should build your second airport near {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_2_BUILD      :To build your second airport in {TOWN}, follow the same steps as when you built the first airport in {TOWN}, as shown by the highlighted buttons. 

STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_1_HANGAR     :Buying an Aircraft{}{}Now you are ready to buy your first aircraft. Click on the hangar building in the airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_2_BUY        :In OpenTTD, you buy the aircraft first, then assign orders to it. Click on the highlighted button to choose an aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_3_SELECT_AIRCRAFT :Select an aircraft by clicking on it, then click on the highlighted button to buy it. You may want to choose the Coleman Count, as this has the highest capacity.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_4_ORDERS     :Next, you will need to assign orders to the aircraft so that it knows where to go. Click on the highlighted button to open the orders window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_5_ORDERS     :Click anywhere on the airport in {TOWN}, excluding the hangar. This gives an order to the aircraft to go to this airport, and load any passengers and mail which are waiting.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_6_STATION_LIST :To get back to your first airport, you can use the station list window which shows a list of all of your stations. Click on the highlighted button on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_7_STATION_LIST :Click on {STATION} in the list.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_8_ORDERS     :Now, in the main viewport, click anywhere on the airport, excluding the hangar. 
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_9_START_AIRCRAFT :Now your aircraft has its orders. Close the orders window using the cross.{}{}The final step is to start your aircraft. Click once on the highlighted horizontal button in the aircraft's window to start it.

Before moving onto the next chapter, this tutorial will show you how to look at some more detailed information about your route.{}{}To see the number of passengers and the amount of mail waiting at an airport, click anywhere on the airport, excluding the hangar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_2_STATION_WINDOW :In this window, you can see at the top the cargo waiting to be collected from the airport.
