STR_INTRO_1         :Intro chapter{}{}Hello and welcome to this ingame OpenTTD tutorial!
STR_INTRO_2         :Chapters:{}{}1. Airplanes{}2. Ships{}3. Road Vehicles{}4. Trains


STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_1_INTRO      :Airplanes - First airport{}{}In this first part we are going to connect two towns using aircraft. We will start by building an airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_2_PLACEMENT  :We will try to place an airport near this town. Please follow the highlighted buttons in the toolbars. 
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_3_ACCEPTANCE :To get many passengers we want to cover as much of the town with the coverage radius. The small airport has a radius of 4 tiles. To visualize the coverage radius you can enable this in the GUI. Click the highlighted button.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_4_ACCEPTANCE :At the bottom of the "airport selection" window, you will notice two lines. One starts with "accepts" and the other starts with "supplies". After the colons, cargo types will be shown in the currently available in the blue area both for pick up ("supplies") and delivery ("accepts"). It's important to put your station there where it is actually able to process cargo.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_5_PLACE_AP   :Move your cursor so that the white squares end up on a flat area with no buildings or roads. Trees will be removed automatically. Make sure that the blue squares around your white rectangle covers as much of the town as you can. Click on the ground to build the airport.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_1_WHERE      :Second Airport{}{}In order to transport passengers they need somewhere to go. So we will continue with the next airport. This airport will be built far away from the first as passengers generally pay more to go further away. We also look for a town with about the same size as the first one so that there is a balance in the demand to go in either direction. The second airport will be placed in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_2_BUILD      :To build the airport in {TOWN} follow the same steps as when we built the airport in {TOWN}. 

STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_1_HANGAR     :Buy an aircraft{}{}Now we are ready to buy an aircraft. Click on the hangar building on the airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_2_BUY        :In OpenTTD we first buy the aircraft and then assign orders to it. Click on the button to buy an aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_3_SELECT_AIRCRAFT :Select an aircraft and click to buy it. You might want to go for Coleman Count, which has highest capacity.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_4_ORDERS     :Next we will assign orders to the aircraft so that it knows what to do. Click on the highlighted button to open the orders window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_5_ORDERS     :Click on the airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_6_TOWN_LIST  :To get back to Town A, you can use the station list window which shows a list of all your stations.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_7_TOWN_LIST  :Click on {STATION} in the list.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_8_ORDERS     :Now click on the airport in the main view port to give the aircraft order to go here.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_9_START_AIRCRAFT :Now we are done assigning orders to the aircraft. The next step is to start it. Click once on the horizontal button in the aircraft window to start it.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_1_SUM_UP     :Sum up{}{}You have now completed your first transport route in OpenTTD. Before rounding up we will take a look at how the transportation works. To see the amount of passengers and mail that is waiting at a station, click on anywhere on the airport except on the hangar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_2_STATION_WINDOW :In this window you can see at the top which cargoes that wait to be picked up by an aircraft. Below the line you can see which cargoes that the station accepts. That is what cargoes can be delivered from another airport to this one. If you click on the ratings button, you will see how good rating your transport service has at this station.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_3_STATION_WINDOW :Knowing how many people are waiting on your airports is important to know when you can buy another airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_4_AIRCRAFT_PROFIT :Another important figure is to see if your aircraft is making profit and how many people is using the aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_5_DONE       :You have now completed the first chapter of this tutorial. Take a look on the aircraft in operation and perhaps add another aircraft. When you feel ready to continue with this guide, click on next.

# Other strings that are not in the regular timeline of messages
STR_AIRPLANES_NOTICE_WAITING_FOR_AP_BUILD :The tutorial is waiting for you to build your airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_HANGAR :Hangar


STR_NO_MORE_CHAPTERS  :There are no more chapters in this tutorial. To remember what you've learned and continue learning more about OpenTTD you might want to try out your new knowledge in a game. Perhaps include one or two AI players so that you can watch their play style.
