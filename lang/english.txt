STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_1_INTRO      :Aircraft - Building the First Airport{}{}In this first chapter, we are going to connect two towns using aircraft. We are going to start by building an airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_2_PLACEMENT  :We are going to try to build an airport near this town. Please click on the highlighted buttons, starting on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_3_ACCEPTANCE :To get the greatest number of passengers at our airport, we want to have as much of the town as possible within the coverage area. The small airport has a coverage area radius of 4 tiles, which can be can be shown using the GUI. Click on the highlighted button.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_4_ACCEPTANCE :At the bottom of the airport selection window, you will notice two lines of text. One starts with "Accepts", while the other starts with "Supplies". After this, those cargo types which are currently available in the coverage area will be shown, both for collection ("Supplies") and delivery ("Accepts"). It's important to place your airport where it will both "Accept" and "Supply" passengers.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_1_5_PLACE_AP   :Move your cursor so that the white squares are on a flat area with no buildings or roads. Any trees will be removed automatically. Make sure that the blue squares, which show the coverage area of the airport, cover as much of the town as possible. Click on the ground to build the airport.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_1_WHERE      :Building the Second Airport{}{}In order to transport passengers they need somewhere to go. So we are going to continue by building a second airport. This airport will be built reasonably far away from the first, as passengers generally pay more the further they travel. We are also going to look for a town with a similar population size to the first one, as this means that there will be an equal amount of passengers going in each direction. We are going to build the second airport near {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_2_2_BUILD      :To build the second airport in {TOWN}, follow the same steps as when we built the first airport in {TOWN}. 

STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_1_HANGAR     :Buying an Aircraft{}{}Now we are ready to buy an aircraft. Click on the hangar building in the airport.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_2_BUY        :In OpenTTD, we buy the aircraft first, then assign orders to it. Click on the highlighted button to choose an aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_3_SELECT_AIRCRAFT :Select an aircraft and click on the highlighted button to buy it. You may want to choose the Coleman Count, as this has the highest capacity.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_4_ORDERS     :Next, we are going to assign orders to the aircraft so that it knows where to go. Click on the highlighted button to open the orders window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_5_ORDERS     :Click on the airport in {TOWN}.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_6_STATION_LIST :To get back to Town A, you can use the station list window which shows a list of all of your stations. Click on the highlighted button on the main toolbar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_7_STATION_LIST :Click on {STATION} in the list.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_8_ORDERS     :Now, in the main viewport, click anywhere on the airport except on the hangar. This gives an order to the aircraft to go to this airport, and load any passengers and mail which are waiting.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_3_9_START_AIRCRAFT :Now we have finished assigning orders to the aircraft. Close the orders window using the cross. The final step is to start the aircraft. Click once on the highlighted horizontal button in the aircraft's window to start it.

STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_1_SUM_UP     :Summary{}{}You have now completed your first transport route in OpenTTD. Before finishing, we are going to take a look at some details of the route. To see the number of passengers and amount of mail waiting at the airport, click anywhere on the airport except on the hangar.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_2_STATION_WINDOW :In this window, you can see at the top the cargo waiting to be collected. Below the line, you can see the different cargo types that the airport accepts. These are the cargo types which can be delivered to this airport from another one. If you click on the ratings button, you will see how good a rating your transport company has at this airport.{}{}Knowing how many people are waiting at your airports is an important factor in deciding when you should buy another aircraft.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_3_AIRCRAFT_PROFIT :Another important thing to check is if your aircraft is making a profit, and how many people are using the aircraft. Click on the highlighted button on the aircraft window to see the aircraft's details.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_4_AIRCRAFT_PROFIT :In this window you can see several details about your aircraft: yearly profit, how much cargo is currently loaded, capacity, etc.{}{}If you would like to rename your aircraft or change the service interval, these can be done using controls in this window.
STR_AIRPLANES_1_4_5_DONE       :You have now completed the first chapter of this tutorial.{}{}Take a look at the aircraft in operation and perhaps add another aircraft. When you feel ready to continue with this guide, close this window and all other windows by pressing the DELETE button on your keyboard.
